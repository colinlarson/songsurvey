# songsurvey
A quick web solution I made to help my band pick its next single. Randomization of song order helps negate order of presentation bias among the data returned. Useful and simple, saves to a text file.

Needs all sorts of work!  Starting with... 

- stripping out all my band's name and info and replacing with generic.  
- break all the inline code out to seperate file includes
- having flash/other file format fallbacks for the audio players
- web interface for uploading songs, customization options, etc so other people can use it without programming knowledge
- a billion other possible things
